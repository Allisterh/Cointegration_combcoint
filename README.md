## Overview

`combcoint` is package which provides, among other things, the
*Combining non-cointegration tests* of Bayer and Hanck. The following
cointegration tests are implemented:

-   `bayerhanck()` to perform the *Combining non-cointegration test*
    which is implemented in two different versions, see the help file,
    with the command `?bayerhnack()` for more information
-   `boswijk()` to perform the Boswijk cointegration test
-   `banerjee()` to perform the banerjee cointregration test

## Installation

<!--
You can install the released version of combcoint from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:


```r
install.packages("combcoint")
```
-->

The development version can be downloaded from
[GitHub](https://github.com/jens-klenke/combcoint) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jens-klenke/combcoint")
```

## Usage

First install the package as described above

``` r
library(combcoint)

combcoint::bayerhanck(sp ~ ibm + ko, data = ibmspko)
```
